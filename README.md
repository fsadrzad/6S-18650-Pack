# 6S-18650-Pack

This project was inspired by Jehugarcia on YouTube. It's a basic 6S pack with a BMS board mounted underneath. Many of these boards can be placed in parallel to achieve higher power outputs. I made it to practice my way to a professional solar storage system. The next revision will add many more features such as thermal cut-off, MPTT charging, ultra-low quiescent current undervoltage lockout, and 12V stepped down output for feeding inverters.
